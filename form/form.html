      <h2>Rental Terms and Conditions</h2>

<h3>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT IMPACT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.</h3>

<h3>1. The Rental Agreement.</h3> These Rental Terms and Conditions, the rental document you receive when you are given access to the car you are renting (the "Rental Contract") any additional agreement signed by you, any documents or agreements (or links to on-line documents or agreements) sent to you electronically in connection with your rental), the Privacy Notice, and the return receipt or record (the "Rental Receipt") with computed rental charges  together constitute the "Rental Agreement" between yourself and Budget Rent A Car System, LLC, or the independent Budget System Licensee identified on the Rental Contract (“Budget”).

<h3>2. Your Rental.</h3>You rent from Budget the car described on the Rental Contract, which rental is solely a transfer of possession and not of ownership. You agree to the terms in the Rental Agreement provided any such term is not prohibited by the law of a jurisdiction covering this rental, in which case such law controls. “You” and “your” refer to the person who signs this agreement, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Budget. You also agree that you are not our agent for any purpose; and that you cannot assign delegate or transfer your obligations under the Rental Agreement and any discrete part thereof.

<h3>3. Changes.</h3> Any change in the Rental Agreement or our rights must be in writing and signed by an authorized Budget officer. You further agree that we have the unilateral right to change these Terms and Conditions from time to time either upon written notice to you, in paper or electronic form, or upon our posting such changes on the Budget web site.  Such changes will apply to rentals that you reserve after such notice has been given, as indicated by the date of such notice, if sent in written form, or the date such changes are posted on the Budget web site, which date will be indicated therein, without any requirement by you to sign the changed Terms and Conditions.  Changes to these Terms and Conditions will be posted as they occur on the Budget web site at www.budget.com and will govern all rentals commencing after posting even if the terms provided at time of reserving the rental car are different.

<h3>. Meaning of Car.</h3>The word “car” in the Rental Agreement means the vehicle rented to you or its replacement and includes tires, tools, keys, key fobs, equipment, included and optional accessories, plates, documents, and any other products or property provided by Budget with the vehicle and separately rented to you by Budget unless otherwise explicitly specified in the Rental Agreement.

<h3>5. Who May Drive The Car.</h3> You represent to Budget that you are a capable and validly licensed driver and will remain a capable and validly licensed driver throughout the term of your rental. You agree that we have the right to verify that your license has been validly issued and is in good standing (not suspended, revoked or otherwise restricted in any way) as a condition precedent to each rental; and that we may in our sole discretion refuse to rent to you if your license is not in good standing. We reserve the right to deny rentals based upon (i) information about your license status, (ii) authenticity of your driver's license or other credentials, (iii) the inability to verify your identity or payment methods, (iv) your driving record provided by the Motor Vehicle Department of the jurisdiction that issued your license, or (v) any other information received from any other source in the business of validating an identity or the driver's license credential that we believe to be reliable. We reserve the right to validate your driving credentials and license good standing periodically without notice to you except as required by law. Except where otherwise specifically authorized by applicable law, only you, your spouse or domestic partner, or, if you rent from us under your employer’s corporate account agreement, your employer or a regular fellow employee incidental to business duties may drive the car (each a "Permitted Driver"), but only with your prior permission. Any Permitted Driver must be at least 25 years old and must also be a capable and validly licensed driver at all times during which such person is operating the car.  Any person other than you or a Permitted Driver that operates the car must sign an additional driver form at the time of the rental. We may charge for each additional driver authorized to drive the car, which will be specified on the Rental Contract. You acknowledge that you will remain financially responsible under the Rental Agreement at all times even if the car is operated by a Permitted Driver or someone other than yourself.

<h3>6. Return of the Car.</h3> You agree to return the car to us in the same condition you received it, ordinary wear and tear excepted, on the date, at the time and to the location specified in the Rental Contract. You must return it sooner on our demand. If you return it earlier or later, a different or higher rental rate may apply and, if returned later, you may also be charged a late return fee. You may not return the car outside of the return location's operating hours unless specifically allowed by that location.  If you do, your responsibility for damage to or loss of the car will continue and all charges stated on the Rental Contract as a periodic rate will continue to accrue until the return location reopens and we process the return of the car. Operating hours vary by location. If we do not find the car when that location opens, your responsibility for all charges and for damage to or loss of the car will continue until the car is actually returned or recovered. If you wish to extend any rental you must contact us at 1-888-897-8448 or use a method we approve to request the extension before your return date. We may or may not grant an extension or decline to grant it for the entire period you request, in our sole discretion. If you do not return the car to the location specified in the Rental Agreement, as and when required under the Rental Agreement, you may be subject to criminal penalties. If we do grant an extension a different or higher rate may be applied to the extension period and a service fee may also apply.

<h3>7. Where You’ll Return the Car.</h3> The car must be returned to the agreed return location as specified on the Rental Contract. If return is indicated to a location other than the location where your rental commences, you may have to pay a one way service fee. If you return the car to a different location from the agreed return location without our permission, you agree to pay an unauthorized return location fee specified by us.

<h3>8. Rental Charges.</h3> You will pay for the number of miles/kilometers you drive and the period of time you rent the car at the rate indicated on the Rental Contract, or your applicable corporate rate. Unless otherwise indicated on the Rental Contract, the minimum charge is one day (24 hours), unless “calendar day” is indicated on the Rental Contract, plus mileage/kilometerage, or a fixed fee. We will determine the miles/kilometers by reading the factory-installed odometer or utilize the vehicle's telematics device. The daily charge applies to consecutive 24 hour periods starting at the hour and minute the rental begins or, if a calendar day is specified on the Rental Contract, each consecutive calendar day or any part of a calendar day starting on the calendar day on which the rental occurs. If you fail to comply with any conditions for special rates specified on the Rental Contract our otherwise applicable rates will be charged. You’ll pay all charges that apply to the rental for miscellaneous services and, where permitted, airport facility fees and/or concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, other fees and surcharges.
